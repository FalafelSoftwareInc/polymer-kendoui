## About polymer-kendoui

Polymer Project Components (http://polymer-project.appspot.com/) for Kendo UI Widgets. If you want to play with Web Components and Kendo UI, you've come to the right place.

## Compatibility and Requirements

polymer-kendoui was designed to work with Kendo UI Web widgets and Web Components, via the [Polymer project](http://polymer-project.appspot.com/)

polymer-kendoui currently depends on the following libraries:

- [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) v1.9.1+
- [Kendo UI](http://www.kendoui.com) vCurrent
- [Polymer](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer) pre-release

polymer-kendoui has not been tested against any other versions of these libraries. You may find that versions other than these are compatible with polymer-kendoui, but we make no claims to support those version, nor can we troubleshoot issues that arise when using those versions.
